### Introduction
This project is about software engineering. It is a maze game project by creating an engine for generating explorable worlds. In this project, we will need to generate a random maze and add some interactive features to the game.

### Mini Game
The game engine will include a Mini Game system that will allow players to interact with entities within the maze, triggering an encounter with a new interface that will return the player to the original interface once the encounter ends, similar to popular games like Pok√©mon.

This system will add an extra layer of excitement and unpredictability to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore every corner of the maze to discover new and exciting encounters.
